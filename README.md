Bugfix only mod without any attempts to change or improve.

Limited to non-UI changes that can be fixed via database or xml.  If logic needs to be changed and can be done via Javascript, it should be done in a non-destructive way. eg. https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/updating-functions-without-overwriting-files-minimizing-conflicts-updated-2025-2-16.695572/#post-16784265

I'll try to do zip deploys to Civfanatics every week or so.

Please create branches from dev branch and create your PR into dev. 

Where the mod is not complicated, favour xml to encourage readablity for less technical people.

Otherwise, SQL is fine.

Ideally, please include a URL link to a well-written bug report (eg. Firaxis support forum, CivFanatics bug report, reply in the above thread, reddit).

Bugfix only mod without any attempts to change or improve. If you have something that's non-UI that might need fixing, comment below and I'll add it. Note. Firaxis will probably fix these any day now, so this mod is probably only of temporary value.

Limited to non-UI changes that can be fixed via database or xml.  If logic needs to be changed and can be done via Javascript, it should be done in a non-destructive way. eg. https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/updating-functions-without-overwriting-files-minimizing-conflicts-updated-2025-2-16.695572/#post-16784265

I'll try to do zip deploys to Civfanatics every week or so.

Please create branches from dev branch and create your PR into dev.
